# Sadiq's Cycles

## A Makers Academy Project

### Task:

Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery jf a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of Docking Stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will run all the Docking Stations, simulate all the Bikes, and emulate all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.
